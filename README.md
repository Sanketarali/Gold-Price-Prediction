# Gold-Price-Prediction
This repository contains code for a project that uses machine learning to predict future gold prices based on historical data. The project is implemented in Python, using the Scikit-learn library for machine learning and Pandas library for data manipulation. The data used for this project is sourced from Kaggle's historical gold prices dataset.

# Dependencies<br>

# Gold Price Prediction
 given some information about dataset like:<br>
 
 1. Date<br>
 2. SPX<br>
 3. GLD<br>
 4. USO<br>
 5. SLV<br>
 6. EUR/USD<br>

 # How  did I do?

<h3>The dataset I am using for the Gold Price Prediction task is downloaded from Kaggle. Now letâ€™s start with this task by importing the necessary Python libraries and dataset:<br></h3>
import numpy as np<br>
import pandas as pd<br>
import seaborn as sns<br>
